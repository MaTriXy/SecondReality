█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄█	? Depends			P Psi
Note: This is not a list of what WILL be in the demo, but a list of what
could be in the demo. Some parts won't be finished in time (surprise!?)
and some will be rejected later after experimenting.... 
		
================ Fully implemented (ready to use in demo):
(none...)

================ Partially implemented:
+ Shadow / 3DS mountain scroller [T]
+ Mirror / 3DS mirrorball scroller [T]
+ 256 color lightsourced glenz [P]
  - transform
  - background piccy fadein
+ Minivectorballdots [P]
  - transform	
  - bounce
  - reverse-bounce (nice)
+ rotating dot-tunnel [T]
+ Desert Dreams' Stars [P]
- Dotcuberise with colorfade [P]
- Lens [P]
- WaterLens [P]
- Lightning routine [P]
- Dotpicture metamorph (logos) [P]
+ Plasma cube [W]
- Techno part
  - interference with sinus
  - 8 times interleaved rotating delay bars (what a name) [P]
- Sinuslines (good old ones) [P]
- Shadebobs (really, I did optimize 'em :-) [P]
+ Infiniteworm (noerase/8 planes) [P]
+ Optimized '3D' sinusworm [T]

================ Being experimented with:
+ Faster Comanche; canyon/cave [P]
- 4 bitplane interference smoke (sounds nice, eh?-) [T]
- rectangular interference => Techno part [P] 
? Shaded tunnel with holes (3DS) [W]

================ Just ideas:
? glass cube [W]
- rotating dotcannon with distancefade and collisions to walls [P]
- 2D jelloblock with delay (blue screen bg)

================ Track transition ideas:
- Panic style end, then continues from the dot with explosion!
- Screen sliced in half from top to bottom, both sides fall to
  left/right.                /\
- Screen divided to vertical \/-bars (3d/offset=0) which start to 
  rotate faster and faster...
  
================ Vector world:
- biiiig zoom from space to a house (nice idea trug, easy to implement :-)
- zoom from vector world to monitor containing demo effects and finally
  back
- jellyforest (line/ega/precalced spring movement) [P]
- fast flying between a huge grid of big cubes. Semitexture if possible [P]
  Going very close sometimes -almost- hitting the walls

================ Rejected?:
- Whirpool [P]
